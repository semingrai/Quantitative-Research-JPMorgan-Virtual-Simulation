# PMorgan Chase Quantitative Research Simulation

This repository contains my work completing the PMorgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Simulation on Forage (Feb 2026). The simulation focused on analyzing credit risk data and estimating probability of default.

## Overview
- Analyzed a book of loans to estimate customer default probability.
- Categorized FICO scores to model borrower risk profiles.
- Performed basic statistical analysis and data handling using Python (Pandas).
- Gained exposure to quantitative research workflows in finance.

## Skills Demonstrated
- Credit Analysis
- Data Analysis & Feature Engineering
- Probability & Statistics
- Python Programming

## Files
- `loan_analysis.ipynb` — Notebook with data processing, categorization, and probability calculations.
